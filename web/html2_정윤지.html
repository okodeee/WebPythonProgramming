 <p>Practicing HTML is fun. <br>So far we have learned <strong>HTML</strong> is a language made of tags that help us describe how we want our webpages to look. We have tried the <em>head, title, H(heading),</em> and paragragh tags so far. <br>
 Very few people know all the tags in HTML, but that is okay because we can do a lot with just some basic tags. We can learn about new tags when we need them.</p>
